                <div class="content-image1"><img src="assets/images/me.jpg" alt="Image taken of me on top of Diamond Hill, Galway"></div>
                <p>I guess I found my love for photography partly due to my love for travel. Travelling & absorbing the intricacies of diverse cultures around the world is a passion of mine. To embrace the diversity in a culture, over a reasonable period of time & evolve my view from "This is Extremely Strange" to “Of course this is normal!” is a mind opening process. Capturing this on an image gives you the opportunity to save that moment in a capsule of time</p>
            <div class="content-image-potrait"><img src="assets/images/5000meters-annapurna_small.Jpg" alt="A selfie I took, near the top of the Annapurna Circuit of the Himalayas in Nepal"></div>
                <p>I often try to emphasise the power of nature in my images & to show no matter how much we manage to mess things it up, nature has got it all under control.</p>
                <div class="content-image"><img src="assets/images/a-nature-wins_small.Jpg" alt="A wall being overtaken with beautiful flowers as an example that nature will always win"></div>
                <p>Out on a wonder with my camera, if something catches my eye or impacts on my emotions, I may not know at that time or ever what it was that captured me.</p> 
                <div class="content-image"><img src="assets/images/duck-mirror_small.Jpg" alt="A mirror image of a duck that almost looks like to is a about to say shucks response to a beautiful compliment"></div>
                <p>I particularly enjoy watching the birds go about there day to day routines, to try to learn the different attributes & characteristics about a variety of different bird familys. I strive to be in nature as much as possible, as the great Leonardo da vinci would say: <br>
                <strong>“Nature is the source of all true knowledge. She has her own logic, her own laws, she has no effect without cause nor invention without necessity.” <br><br> “The wisest & nobelist teacher is nature itself.”</strong></p>
                <div class="content-image-potrait"><img src="assets/images/bird-beauty_small.Jpg" alt="A song Thrush looking at the camera curiously"></div>
                <p>I am in many ways what is called a late bloomer, it may have taken time to find my passions but I learned so much from a variety of perspectives along the path to finding them.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Extremely interested in new technology & the endless opportunities to create anew.</p>
                <div class="content-image"><img src="assets/images/a-buttercup_small.Jpg" alt="A yellow buttercup with blurred background"></div>
                <p>I love to look around me & find the beauty in nature, by finding a different perspective. Focusing on it without distractions, this can open you up to see its true essence</p>
                <div class="content-image"><img src="assets/images/a-cat+nature_small.Jpg" alt="A cat raising her head to look at the camera lying down on a car under a display of flowers"></div>
                <p>I guess my mission from the beginning was to put a sharp focus on the beauty of the world in times when there are so many distractions to deviate your perspective from seeing what is around you.</p>
                <div class="content-image"><img src="assets/images/a-donkey-dance_small.Jpg" alt="A donkey posing a dance move on the background of Tipperary countryside with flowers in the backdrop"></div> 
                <p>To shine a light on the incredible ever changing world, away from the media to the greatest artist that is nature</p>
                <div class="content-image"><img src="assets/images/a-smiling-daisy_small.Jpg" alt="A Shasta daisy up close, looking like it is smiling"></div>
                <p>A self trained photographer, who tries to capture the beauty of passing moments. It's like finding light in a dark place, if you are not looking for it, you may not find it.</p>
                <div class="content-image"><img src="assets/images/a-heart-shaped-flower_small.Jpg" alt="Heart shaped flower in the colour pink"></div>
